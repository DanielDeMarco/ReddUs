# ReddUs
###A web application for sharing reddit content build on Meteor
-------------------------------------

This is a working project. This is an application that uses redditâ€™s RESTful API to create a rich web content sharing experience for users. Users can create groups and submit reddit content through links. The an API request then retrieves data from the Post and creates a material card that it posted to the group. The users can then chat and discuss post in real time using real time subscriptions to a MongoDB Database.
